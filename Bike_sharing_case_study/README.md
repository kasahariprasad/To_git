## General Information

Essentially, the company wants —

- To understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19.

- To understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends.

- To understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.

- The company wants to know:
        * Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
        * How well those variables describe the bike demands
        
- The dataset being analysed for this case study is "day.csv" file


## Conclusions
- Linear relation between variables 'temp','atemp' and 'cnt'                                  
- As per analysis major influencers are temperature,weather situation(weathersit_3),year
       where weathersit_3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds
